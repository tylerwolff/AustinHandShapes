        Raised on the island of Maui, Drew Austin first took up surfing at the age of 3.
        Being pushed into waves at the local long boarding spot by his older brother and
        now primary glasser Aaron Austin. Throughout Drews life he has chased his
        obsession of surfing by living in some of surfings most coveted areas, Maui,
        Hawaiâ€™i and Santa Barbara, California. Growing up in Maui meant being a Short
        boarder as Maui is known for its HIGH performance surfing. Santa Barbara is where
        Drew realized the different styles and avenues surfing could go and started down
        the alternative path of board building. In 2021 Drew moved to Brooklyn New York to
        start working at Kings Glassing to hone in on the skill of hand shaping
        surfboards. Drew is now determined to make some of the worlds highest quality
        progressive alternative shaped surfboards.
